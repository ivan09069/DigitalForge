# 🔥 DigitalForge

**DigitalForge** is the active production layer of EchoForge.  
It is where systems are built, stressed, observed, and refined under load.

This is not a showcase.  
This is a forge floor.

## Forge Status

> **This repository is forged, not finalized.**  
> Artifacts may evolve, reorder, or be replaced as systems mature.

What you see here is under load.  
What survives gets hardened.  
What doesn't gets reforged or removed.

If you're looking for polish, visit [EchoForge](https://github.com/ivan09069/EchoForge).  
If you're looking for process, you're in the right place.

## What DigitalForge Is

DigitalForge is a **working environment** for:
- Live systems
- Measurable processes
- Predictive signals
- Controlled energy

It favors **clarity over polish** and **process over presentation**.

If something glows here, it is doing work.

## Forge Floor Systems

| Zone | System | Status | Function |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| Core Process | [SwarmSentinel-v3](https://github.com/ivan09069/SwarmSentinel-v3) | 🔥 Active | Sentiment → whale → regime → strategy |
| Heat / Load | [jit-command-center](https://github.com/ivan09069/jit-command-center) | 🔥 Active | Infrastructure monitoring |
| Feed / Intake | Base-Sniper | 🔧 Forging | Token signals, market data |
| Control Rail | EchoForge-agents | 🔧 Forging | Agent orchestration |

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Visibility Before Mystery
All systems expose state, load, latency, and failure edges.  
Trust is earned through transparency.

### 2. Energy Is Directed
No decorative motion. No idle animation.  
Movement shows flow, stress, instability, or direction of attention.

### 3. Signals, Not Instructions
DigitalForge does not tell operators what to do.  
It provides predictive hints and directional signals.  
The operator decides. Skill matters.

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| [FORGE_FLOOR.md](FORGE_FLOOR.md) | UI doctrine, zones, control patterns |
| [SIGNALS.md](SIGNALS.md) | Predictive Signal Layer specification |
| [PHASES.md](PHASES.md) | Forge Floor → Signal Tower → Blacksite |

## Reference

| Reference | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| [color-system.md](reference/color-system.md) | State colors, never theme |
| [state-machine.md](reference/state-machine.md) | System state transitions |
| [ui-zones.md](reference/ui-zones.md) | Feed / Core / Heat / Control |

## Design Ethos

- Monospace over ornament
- Numbers over icons
- Fewer alerts, higher trust
- Imperfection is acceptable if it is mechanical

A forge is never clean.  
It is precise.

---

## If You're Here

If you are reading this:
- Expect incomplete edges
- Expect heat
- Expect systems mid-process

Nothing here pretends to be finished.

---

## Final Note

DigitalForge exists to make **operators better**, not dependent.

If the interface feels quiet, that means it's working.
